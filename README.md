> **KeepIt** is a **clean**, **elegant** but **advanced** blog theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

It is based on the original [LeaveIt Theme](https://github.com/liuzc/LeaveIt) and [KeepIt Theme](https://github.com/Fastbyte01/KeepIt).

Since the three themes have a similar look, if you have questions about their differences,
read [Why choose KeepIt](#why-choose-keepit) so that you can choose the one that works best for you.

## [Demo Site](https://suspicious-archimedes-ab369d.netlify.app/)

To see this theme in action, here is a live [demo site](https://suspicious-archimedes-ab369d.netlify.app/) which is rendered with **KeepIt** theme.

## Why choose KeepIt

Compared to the original LeaveIt theme and the KeepIt theme, the KeepIt theme has the following modifications.

* Custom **Header**
* Custom **CSS Style**
* A new **home page**, compatible with the latest version of Hugo
* A lot of **style detail adjustments,** including color, font size, margins, code preview style
* More readable **dark mode**
* Some beautiful **CSS animations**
* Easy-to-use and self-expanding **table of contents**
* More **social links**, **share sites** and **comment system**
* **Search** supported by [Lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com/) or [algolia](https://www.algolia.com/)
* **Copy code** to clipboard with one click
* Extended Markdown syntax for **[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons**
* Extended Markdown syntax for **ruby annotation**
* Extended Markdown syntax for **fraction**
* **Mathematical formula** supported by [KaTeX](https://katex.org/)
* **Diagram syntax** shortcode supported by [mermaid](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid)
* **Interactive data visualization** shortcode supported by [ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/)
* **Mapbox** shortcode supported by [Mapbox GL JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js)

* **Bilibili** player supported
* Kinds of **admonitions** shortcode supported
* Custom style shortcodes supported
* **CDN** for all third-party libraries supported
* ...

In short,
if you prefer the design language and freedom of the KeepIt theme,
if you want to use the extended Font Awesome icons conveniently,
if you want to embed mathematical formulas, flowcharts, music or Bilibili videos in your posts,
the KeepIt theme may be more suitable for you.

I hope you will KeepIt ❤️!

## [Documentation](https://suspicious-archimedes-ab369d.netlify.app/categories/documentation/)

Build Documentation Locally:

```bash
hugo server --source=exampleSite
```

## Install dependencies and build assets

This theme relies on JavaScript assets that need to be compiled before Hugo can
use them. From the theme directory run:

```bash
npm install
npm run build       # or `npm run start` for a live server
```

These commands generate `assets/js/theme.js` and other resources consumed by
Hugo.

* English
* Simplified Chinese
